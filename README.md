# Reiuji
A library for designing NuclearCraft multiblocks.

Reiuji is named after [Utsuho Reiuji](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Utsuho_Reiuji), the main antagonist of [*Subterranean Animism*](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Subterranean_Animism).

## Installation

Most users won't have to install Reiuji directly (see Usage below for more information). But if you need to do so, it can be installed via pip using the command below:
```shell
pip install reiuji-nuclearcraft
```

## Features

- Designers for:
  - **NuclearCraft: Overhauled** turbine rotors and dynamos.
  - **QMD** linear and synchrotron accelerators/decelerators.
  - **QMD** nucleosynthesis chambers.
- NBT schematic writers for copy-and-pasting designed structures directly into Minecraft worlds.

**Note:** Features already covered by other programs like [LEU-235](https://leu-235.com/) will have lower priority. NuclearCraft Classic molten salt reactor and heat exchanger designers might never be implemented due to their complexity.

## Usage

Reiuji has a command line interface that can be found [here](https://github.com/MtCelesteMa/reiuji-cli).

There is also a web app in the works.
