# Reiuji
A library for designing NuclearCraft multiblocks.

Reiuji is named after [Utsuho Reiuji](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Utsuho_Reiuji), the main antagonist of [*Subterranean Animism*](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Subterranean_Animism).

## Installation

Reiuji can be installed using pip via the following command
```shell
pip install "git+https://github.com/MtCelesteMa/reiuji.git"
```

## Features

- Designers for:
  - **NuclearCraft: Overhauled** turbine rotors and dynamos.
  - **QMD** linear and synchrotron accelerators/decelerators.
  - **QMD** nucleosynthesis chambers.
- NBT schematic writers for copy-and-pasting designed structures directly into Minecraft worlds.

**Note:** Features already covered by other programs like [LEU-235](https://leu-235.com/) will have lower priority. NuclearCraft Classic molten salt reactor and heat exchanger designers might never be implemented due to their complexity.

## Usage
